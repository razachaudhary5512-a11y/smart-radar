      <p>
        Smart Radar (“we”, “the app”) is a neighbourhood app that shows posts, alerts and services near you. This policy explains what we collect, why, and the
        choices you have. We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data and we do <strong>not</strong> show third-party ads.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account:</strong> your email address (used to sign in with a one-time link or code) and the display name you choose.</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> with your permission, your device location is used to show posts within the radius you pick (1–50 km) and to place
            posts you create on the map. You can instead choose a city manually. We do not track your location in the background.</li>
          <li><strong>Content you post:</strong> posts, photos, comments, votes, RSVPs, bookmarks and business listings.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification (optional):</strong> if you request a verified badge, your CNIC number. It is visible only to the app owner and admins for
            checking, never to other users.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety & moderation:</strong> reports you make, and actions taken by admins, are logged to keep the community safe.</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications (optional):</strong> a device token, only if you turn notifications on.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How we use it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To run the app: sign you in, show nearby posts, and let neighbours see what you share.</li>
          <li>To keep the community safe: moderate reported content and suspend abusive accounts.</li>
          <li>To improve reliability and fix problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What other people can see</h2>
        <p>
          Your display name, profile picture, trust score, verified badge and the posts you publish are visible to other users. Your email address, phone
          number and CNIC are never shown to other users.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Services we use</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — secure database, file storage and sign-in.</li>
          <li><strong>OpenStreetMap / Nominatim</strong> — maps and city search (your search text is sent to look up places).</li>
          <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong> — push notifications, only if enabled.</li>
          <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> — hosting of the website version.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data is sent over encrypted connections (HTTPS). Access to the database is restricted by row-level security rules.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your choices and rights</h2>

          <li><strong>Delete your account:</strong> Profile → Privacy &amp; data → Delete my account. This permanently removes your account, posts, comments,
            photos and listings straight away.</li>
          <li>You can turn off location permission and notifications at any time in your phone settings.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your data while your account exists. When you delete your account, your personal data and content are deleted. Records of admin
          moderation actions are kept without your personal details.
